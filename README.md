📄 My First Web Page – README
🌐 Overview
This project is a simple HTML web page titled "My First Web Page". It is a beginner-friendly introduction to basic HTML5 elements such as paragraphs, lists, semantic tags, and hyperlinks. The content is structured to demonstrate good practice in web page layout using semantic HTML elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.

🧱 Structure
<head>
Sets the character encoding (UTF-8)

Sets the page viewport for responsive design

Specifies the page title: "My First Web Page"

<body>
Contains the main visible content of the page, including:

✅ Basic Elements:
Paragraphs (<p>): Introduces text like "Coding is amazing" and "My name is Emmanuel"

Unordered List (<ul>): Lists school subjects

Ordered List (<ol type="i" start="20">): Starts at Roman numeral xx (20) and lists tech topics

🔗 Anchor Tag:
A link to Facebook

🧩 Semantic HTML Elements:
<header>
Contains the main heading (<h1>) welcoming users

Includes a simple navigation menu with links

<main>
Holds the main content of the page:

<article>: Repeats introductory paragraphs

<section>: Lists favorite hobbies using a bullet list

<aside>: Displays "Quick links" with a placeholder anchor (currently set to href="&" — this should be fixed)

<footer>
Displays the copyright:

📝 Notes
Placeholder Link Warning: The href="&" in the <aside> section should be replaced with a valid URL or # if it's meant to be a placeholder.

Redundancy: The paragraphs about "Coding is amazing" and "My name is Emmanuel" appear both at the top and inside the <article>—this could be streamlined.

Consistency: It might be helpful to add heading tags for all sections for better structure and SEO.

🚀 How to Use
Copy and paste the code into a .html file (e.g., index.html).

Open the file with any web browser.

You will see a simple static web page showcasing basic HTML elements.
